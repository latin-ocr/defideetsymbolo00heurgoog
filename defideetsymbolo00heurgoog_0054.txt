moranus. 41

Both Gyril's letter and Leo's receive in the Definitio
Fidei of the Council of Chalcedon the deliberate eano-

- tion of that Gonnoil·, as st. Gyril'o had before received

that of the Council of Ephesus as well as that of the
Alexandrian Synod cf which it was the umente.
They are to be regarded therefore aa expositione,
stamped with the authority of the Universa] Ohnrch,
of the Artiole to which they relate. In this respect
they stand upon a higher footing then the expositione
of individual Fathers, however venerable their names.

Their dates are respectively, Cyril’s Epietle to Nes·
torius, nn. 430, Leo's to Flavian, nn. 449.
