2. Καὶ εἷς Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν, τὸν Υίὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν μονο-
γενῆν
τὸν Κῦριον ἡμῶν·
3. Τὸν γεννηθέντα ἐκ Πνεῦματος ἁγίου
καὶ Μαρίας τῆς Παρθένου·
4. Τὸν ἐπὶ Ποντίου Πιλάτου σταυρωθέντα,
καί ταφέντα·
5. Kal τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἀναστάντα ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν·
6. Ἀναβάντα εἷς τοὺς οὐρανοὺς,
Καὶ καθήμενον ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ Πατρός·
