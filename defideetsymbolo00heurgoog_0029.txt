8. SYMBOLUM CONSTANTINOPOLITANUMl.
A.D. 381.

Tan Oreed put forth by the Gouncil of Constantinople
is, as I have already hinted, identical almost to the

letter with the former of the Oreeds given by Epi* ‘

phanius. rhe additions therein mado (it is said, by
Gregory Nyssenh) to the original Nicene (head, and
already extensively accepted ¹, now received the full
sanction of the Ohuroh Universal.

The Oreod varies, es it is well known, in ona im-
portant particular from the formula now used through·

out Westerp Christendom: it makes no mention of the

processioa from theson in the eighth article. When
η the “Filioque'’ was first inserted is not certainly known.
, The earliest copy of the constantinopolitan Oreed in
which it is found is that which was recited at the third
Gonnoil of Toledo, nn. 589. But there arc doubts as
to the genuineness of the text. Earlier dates have been
assigned by some, as a Gallican Council, nn. 447 or 448,
and tho first (louncil of Bracara, nn. 411. But though
Confessions of saith, containing the assertion ot* the
procession from the Son, are given as recited at these
- Councils, the constantinopolitan formula is not one
of thern. '
