Tan Definitio aldai of the Council of Chalcedon bears
much the same relation to the Creeds of Nicaea and Con·
stantinople that the Athanasian Creed does to the Apo· ·
stlcs’. While it embodies the two first-mentioued, it
expauds the Qle relating to the Incarnation in like
manner as the Athauasian Oreed expande both thet f
Article and the Anticles which relate to the sacred*

, awa· ·

The heresies which the Definitio Fidei had especially
in view were those of Nestorius and Eutyches. Nes-
arius sau ‘auaay seen ao‘fffficuy tua counau of
Ephesus; *but it was necewary in guarding against
the errors of Eutyches to guard against those of Nes·
torius also. It will be seen, as I have already hinted‚
on a comparison between this document aud the Creed
of st. Athanasius, with how much reason the last-
mentioned is supposed to have been framed antece·
dently to the prevaleuce of both these heresies.

It should be noticed how careful the Oouncil are to
guard against the supposition that they are pulting
forth a new Confession of Eaith, and so contraven‘
the seventh canon of the Council of Ephesus.
