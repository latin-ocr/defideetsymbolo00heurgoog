6, 7. SYMBOLA APUD EPIPHANIUM‘.
, A.D. 373.

Tnn two following Oreeds are⁴ preserved by Epipha-
nius in his Anoorate‚ which was written, as he states,
in the year 373. The fonner is identioal‚ almost to the
letter, with the Creed whioh eight ¹years atterwards
was adopted by the counoil of Constantinople.

nne seoond Oreed is an expansion of the former, as
that was of tho original Nioene (lreed on those points
on whioh tho reoent heresies of Apollinaiis and Maee-
donius had mede it necessary to define the saith with
inoreased precision. The correspondenoe between its
languago on the incarnation, in the third Artiole, and
that of the Athanasian Creed‚ on the sama subjeot, is
deserving of special notice. A eomparison with tho lan-
guage of the Definitio aab· of the Chalcedon counoil
puts it beyond a doubt that the Athanasian Oreed be-

longs to tho age of the earlier rather than to that of ·

tho later ΐονιαοΙαιγ.Ι

1. ΠΙΣΤΕΥΟΜΕΝ εἰς ἕνα θεὸν Πατέρα παντοκράτορο,
ποιητὴν οὐρανοῦ τε καὶ γῆς, ὁρατῶν τε πάντων καὶ ἀορά-
των·
2. Kal εἷς ἕνα Κύριον, Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν,
τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ τὸν μονογενῆ,
τὸν ἔκ τοῦ Πατρὸς γεννηθέντα πρὸ πάντων τῶν αἶῶνων
