4. SYMBOLUM AQUILEIENSE EX RUPINI
COMMENTARIO.
Oiro. al). 400.

Rsnnms was a presbyter of Aquileia; and the Oreed
which forms the subject of his exposition is the Oreed
of the Aquileian Ohnroh. He notes, however, as he
proceeds, sundry discrepaneies between this Greed and
that of the Oburoh of Rome, so that we thus obtain the
text of the Roman (ireed of his day as well as that of

¹ the Aquileiam

Vallarsius, from whose text the Commentary of Ru·
finus given below is printed, has “in Deo Patre,” doe,
“in Christo J esu‚'' doe„ “in Spiritu Sancto ;'' Pamelius
and Bp. Fell, and the first printed edition, Oxou, 1486,
have, “ in Deum Patrem,'’ “ in Christum Jesum‚’' “ in
Spiritum Sanctum.'' Others, while they read “ in Deum
Patrem,” “ in Christum J esum,” in the first and seoond
Artieles respectively, read “ in Spiritu Sanoto’' in the
eighth. Among sundry other Oreeds whioh exhibit the

’ lile variation of ease is an English one of the fourteenth
century, “ I bileve into God Fader almygti,’' “And into
Jesu Orist‚” da, ⁴⁴1 belieue in the holi goost.'’ See
Harmonia Symbolioa, pp. 27, 96.

Ihove adopted Vallarsius's text in the first of the
following Greeds; but in the seoond, that of Pamelius,
whioh represents the Roman formula in aeoordanoe
with the type in whioh it is usually found.
