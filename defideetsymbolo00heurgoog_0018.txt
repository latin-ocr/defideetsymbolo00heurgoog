Tiro Oreed of Nicaea was adeliberate declaration oi
the saith, put forth by a Gonnoil oi the Ohuroh Uni-
versal to guard against the heresy of Arius, whioh, had

begun to make hawoe of Christ's fold. Its character· ’

istio feature, as distinguished from the Oreed which
Eusebius had presented to the Counoil, and indeed
from ali previous Creedsgwas the insertion of the
words ἐκ τῆς οὐσίαι· τοῦ, Πατρὸς and duossimus in the
ssaond Artiele.

bius’s end attho eighth Artiole, the reason bfeing doubt-
less, in both cases, not that the following Anticles had
not as yet a plane in the Oreed, but that no question
having been moved respecting them, it was not thought
necessary to repeat them.

2. Καὶ εἷς ἕνα Κύριον, Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν,
τὸν Υἶὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ,
γεννηθέντα ἐκ τοῦ Πατρὸο μονογενῆ,
τουτέστιν ἐκ τῆς οὐσίας τοῦ Πατρὸς,
Θεὸν εἰ( Θεοῦ,
Φῶς ἐκ dordr,
Θεὸν ἀληθινὸν εἰι Θεοῦ ἀληθινοῦ,
γεννηθέντα, οῦ ποιηθέντα,
ὁμοοῦσιον τῷ Harpi-
δι’ οῦ rd πάντα ἐγένετο, τὰ τε ἒν τῷ οὐρανῷ καὶ τὰ ἐν
