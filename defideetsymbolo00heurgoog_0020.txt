Maon doubt exista as to the date of the Apostolioul
Constitutione: but Bp. Pearson,' with considerable pro·
bability, oonjeetures them to be anatoth-work, made up
of documents belonging to various ages, which, how-
ever, must have been put together· before the Gonnoil

of Chalcedon, nu. 451. If the clause, οὗ τῆς βασιλείας “
οὐκ ἔσται ador, be nota later addition, the Oreed oannot ’

be assigned to an earlier date than the time of Mareel-
lus» of braym, about un. 340, against whose beresy,
then newly broaohed‚ it would seem to have been di-
rected. See Oyril. Hieros. Cateoh„ xv. ᾖ 27. Like
the shorter Jerusalem Greed above given (p. 1), it is
